# whtr
"Use the load duration curve Luke"

So a first, fairly limited functionality, version of the code.  The Load Duration Curve method is currently deactivated (because it is a mess right now... look if you dare).  Given this is half the reason whtr exists, this situation won't remain so for very long... ;-)  The other half of the reason, Simulated Scenarios, isn't even in the code yet. :-(
But the bare bones is there.

For anyone new to this kind of thing, your best bet is to navigate to the folder you download this to & try: ./whtr.py
Good luck (that's what works in a linux environment... not sure how Windows installs do it)

Also, tested on a Debian stable machine.  So other operating systems could easily have issues.  Runs off Python3 (& pandas), with rpy2 and obviously R.
More details to follow soon...
